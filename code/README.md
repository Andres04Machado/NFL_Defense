## Code Folder

This folder contains the `.R` script that served as the foundation for the entire project: `NFL_Adv_Defense.R`. While it may appear somewhat disorganized due to our limited experience at the time of its creation, we have endeavored to enhance its legibility by making minor cosmetic improvements. However, the underlying structure remains unchanged, reflecting the original version written in Spring 2024.
It is important to note that the data underlying the project is not publicly available, which may pose challenges in replicating the results obtained. Nevertheless, we trust that this R script provides a glimpse into our thought process and approach for addressing this specific problem.
